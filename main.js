Hi there! You've stumbled across a farm where all the ducks have escaped and the farmer needs your help to find them. 

Your mission is to complete the findMissingDucks function that takes in an array of present duck IDs. This array is unsorted and possibly contains duplicates. 

There are 40 ducks in total
The output array of missingDucks should have all missing IDs in ascending order. 

Example 
Input (ducks that are NOT missing): [30, 23, 12, 10, 5, 28, 17, 2, 9, 11, 16, 39, 24, 21, 18]

Complete the function below to see if it passes!

export function findMissingDucks(presentDuckIds) {

}
